# Feature Specification: Send Slack Message to Channel

**Feature Branch**: `002-send-slack-message`  
**Created**: 2025-09-23  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "send slack message to channel. channel id and message is passed from args. Slack authentication info is passed from env."

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Completed: Feature description parsed
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identified: console application, Slack API integration, environment-based auth, CLI args
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí RESOLVED: Message content format supports markdown formatting
   ‚Üí RESOLVED: Error handling strategy uses retry with maximum 3 attempts
   ‚Üí RESOLVED: No channel validation required before sending
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí User flow identified: CLI invocation with args
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement testable and focused on behavior
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí Message, Channel, Authentication credentials
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí SUCCESS: All clarifications resolved
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story

As a developer or system administrator, I want to send messages to specific Slack channels programmatically so that I can integrate notifications into automated workflows and scripts.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** valid Slack authentication credentials in environment and a valid channel ID, **When** I run the application with channel ID and markdown message content as arguments, **Then** the message is posted to the specified Slack channel with markdown formatting preserved
2. **Given** valid authentication but an invalid channel ID, **When** I attempt to send a message, **Then** the system retries up to 3 times then returns an error indicating the channel cannot be found
3. **Given** invalid or missing authentication credentials, **When** I attempt to send a message, **Then** the system returns an authentication error without retrying
4. **Given** valid inputs but Slack API is temporarily unavailable, **When** I attempt to send a message, **Then** the system retries up to 3 times with backoff before failing gracefully

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the message content is empty or exceeds Slack's character limits?
- How does the system handle network timeouts or intermittent connectivity?
- What occurs when the bot lacks permission to post in the specified channel?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST accept channel ID as a command-line argument
- **FR-002**: System MUST accept message content as a command-line argument
- **FR-003**: System MUST read Slack authentication credentials from environment variables
- **FR-004**: System MUST validate that required arguments are provided before attempting to send
- **FR-005**: System MUST authenticate with Slack API using provided credentials
- **FR-006**: System MUST post the message to the specified channel via Slack API
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide clear success confirmation when message is sent
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide descriptive error messages for failures (auth, network, invalid channel, etc.)
- **FR-009**: System MUST respect Slack API rate limits and retry failed requests up to 3 times with exponential backoff
- **FR-010**: System MUST support markdown formatting in message content
- **FR-011**: System MUST send messages directly to specified channels without pre-validation

### Key Entities

- **Message**: Markdown-formatted text content to be sent, subject to Slack's character limits and markdown syntax
- **Channel**: Slack channel identifier, represents the destination for the message (no pre-validation required)
- **Authentication**: Credentials needed to authenticate with Slack API, stored in environment variables
