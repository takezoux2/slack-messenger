# Research: TypeScript Console Application Setup

## Technology Decisions

### TypeScript Configuration

**Decision**: TypeScript 5.x with strict configuration  
**Rationale**:

- Provides strong type safety and modern JavaScript features
- Strict mode enforces best practices and catches common errors
- Excellent IDE support and refactoring capabilities
- Required by constitutional TypeScript-First Development principle

**Alternatives considered**:

- Plain JavaScript (rejected: no type safety)
- Babel with TypeScript (rejected: unnecessary complexity for console app)

### Testing Framework

**Decision**: Vitest  
**Rationale**:

- Fast and modern test runner with native ESM support
- Excellent TypeScript integration out of the box
- Hot module replacement for faster development
- Compatible with Jest API but faster
- Good coverage reporting capabilities

**Alternatives considered**:

- Jest (rejected: slower, more complex ESM setup)
- Mocha + Chai (rejected: requires more configuration)
- Node.js built-in test runner (rejected: less mature tooling)

### Package Manager

**Decision**: Yarn  
**Rationale**:

- Required by constitutional Yarn Package Management principle
- Deterministic dependency resolution with lockfile
- Faster than npm for most operations
- Better workspace support for potential future monorepo needs

**Alternatives considered**:

- npm (rejected: constitutional requirement for Yarn)
- pnpm (rejected: constitutional requirement for Yarn)

### Build Configuration

**Decision**: TypeScript compiler (tsc) direct usage  
**Rationale**:

- Simple and direct compilation to "dist" directory
- No additional bundling complexity needed for console app
- Fast compilation and source map generation
- Easy to configure output directory structure

**Alternatives considered**:

- esbuild (rejected: unnecessary complexity for simple console app)
- Webpack (rejected: overkill for console application)
- Rollup (rejected: primarily for libraries, not console apps)

### Node.js Version

**Decision**: Node.js 21 as minimum requirement  
**Rationale**:

- Latest LTS features and performance improvements
- Native ESM support with excellent stability
- Modern JavaScript features available
- Specified in feature requirements

**Alternatives considered**:

- Node.js 18 LTS (rejected: requirement specifies version 21)
- Node.js 20 (rejected: requirement specifies version 21)

### Linting and Formatting

**Decision**: ESLint + Prettier combination  
**Rationale**:

- ESLint with TypeScript parser for code quality
- Prettier for consistent code formatting
- Constitutional requirement for code quality standards
- Wide ecosystem support and IDE integration

**Alternatives considered**:

- TSLint (rejected: deprecated in favor of ESLint)
- Biome (rejected: less mature, prefer established tooling)

## Project Structure Decisions

### Source Organization

**Decision**: Standard src/ and tests/ structure  
**Rationale**:

- Clear separation of source code and tests
- Follows TypeScript community conventions
- Easy to configure build tools
- Scales well for future additions

### Configuration Files

**Decision**: Separate config files for each tool  
**Rationale**:

- tsconfig.json for TypeScript compiler settings
- vitest.config.ts for test configuration
- package.json for scripts and dependencies
- .eslintrc and .prettierrc for code quality
- Clear separation of concerns

### Entry Point

**Decision**: src/main.ts as application entry point  
**Rationale**:

- Conventional naming for main application file
- Clear purpose and discoverable location
- Will contain simple "hello world" console.log statement
- Compiles to dist/main.js for execution

## Implementation Approach

### Development Workflow

1. Set up package.json with Node.js 21 requirement
2. Configure TypeScript with strict settings and "dist" output
3. Configure Vitest for testing with TypeScript support
4. Set up ESLint and Prettier for code quality
5. Create basic src/main.ts with console.log("hello world")
6. Configure build scripts for compilation and execution
7. Add test for main functionality

### Build Process

- `yarn build`: Compile TypeScript to dist/ directory
- `yarn start`: Execute compiled JavaScript from dist/
- `yarn dev`: Watch mode compilation for development
- `yarn test`: Run Vitest test suite
- `yarn lint`: Check code quality with ESLint

All research questions resolved - ready for Phase 1 design.
