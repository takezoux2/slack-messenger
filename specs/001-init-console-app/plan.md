# Implementation Plan: Initialize TypeScript Console Application

**Branch**: `001-init-console-app` | **Date**: 2025-09-23 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-init-console-app/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)

```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code or `AGENTS.md` for opencode).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:

- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary

Initialize a TypeScript console application project with proper configuration, dependency management, Node.js 22 compatibility, Vitest testing framework, and build output to "dist" directory. The application will demonstrate basic console functionality with a "hello world" message in main.ts.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.x with Node.js 22  
**Primary Dependencies**: TypeScript compiler, Vitest testing framework, ESLint, Prettier  
**Storage**: N/A (console application)  
**Testing**: Vitest for unit testing  
**Target Platform**: Node.js 22+ runtime environment  
**Project Type**: single - console application  
**Performance Goals**: Fast startup time for CLI usage  
**Constraints**: Must output to "dist" directory, strict TypeScript configuration  
**Scale/Scope**: Single console application with basic functionality  
**User Requirements**: Print "hello world" in main.ts entry point

## Constitution Check

_GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design._

✅ **TypeScript-First Development**: Using TypeScript with strict configuration and explicit types  
✅ **Yarn Package Management**: Will use Yarn for dependency management with lockfile  
✅ **Test-First Development**: Vitest framework configured for TDD approach  
✅ **Specification-Driven Development**: Following .specify framework with complete spec.md  
✅ **Slack API Compliance**: N/A for console application initialization

**Initial Assessment**: PASS - All applicable constitutional principles are met

**Post-Design Assessment**: PASS - Design maintains constitutional compliance:

- TypeScript strict mode enforced in tsconfig.json
- Yarn specified as package manager in all documentation
- Vitest test framework with TDD workflow documented
- Complete specification-driven approach with research and contracts
- No new constitutional violations introduced

# Option 3: Mobile + API (when "iOS/Android" detected)
api/
└── [same as backend above]

ios/ or android/
└── [platform-specific structure]
```

**Structure Decision**: Option 1 (Single project) - Console application with src/ and tests/ directories

## Phase 0: Outline & Research

1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:

   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:

   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts

_Prerequisites: research.md complete_

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:

   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:

   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:

   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:

   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/powershell/update-agent-context.ps1 -AgentType copilot`
     **IMPORTANT**: Execute it exactly as specified above. Do not add or remove any arguments.
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/\*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach

_This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan_

**Task Generation Strategy**:

- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Project setup tasks: package.json, tsconfig.json, vitest.config.ts
- Configuration tasks: ESLint, Prettier, build scripts
- Core implementation: src/main.ts with "hello world" output
- Testing tasks: Unit tests for main functionality
- Validation tasks: Build verification, quickstart execution

**Ordering Strategy**:

- TDD order: Configuration and test setup before implementation
- Dependency order: Package management before TypeScript config before source code
- Mark [P] for parallel execution where files are independent
- Sequential for dependent configurations

**Estimated Output**: 15-20 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md covering:

1. Package.json setup with Node.js 22 and Yarn
2. TypeScript configuration with strict mode and "dist" output
3. Vitest test framework configuration
4. ESLint and Prettier setup for code quality
5. Source directory structure creation
6. Test file creation (TDD approach)
7. Main application implementation (src/main.ts)
8. Build script verification
9. Quickstart guide validation

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation

_These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command_

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking

_Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified_

| Violation                  | Why Needed         | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
| -------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| [e.g., 4th project]        | [current need]     | [why 3 projects insufficient]        |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient]  |
