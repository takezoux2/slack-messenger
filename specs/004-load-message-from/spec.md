# Feature Specification: Load message from markdown file

**Feature Branch**: `004-load-message-from`  
**Created**: 2025-09-24  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Load message from markdown file. file name is passed from args. Also keep to receive message from args."

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
	‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
	‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
	‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
	‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
	‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
	‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
	‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
	‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation

When creating this spec from a user prompt:

1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing (mandatory)

### Primary User Story

As a user running the messaging CLI, I want to provide a path to a markdown file so the CLI uses the file's text as the message content, while still allowing me to provide the message text directly as an argument when I prefer.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. Given a valid path to a markdown file is provided as input, When I run the command to send or broadcast a message, Then the message content used is exactly the text from the file and the command completes successfully.
2. Given only a direct message string is provided via arguments, When I run the command, Then the system uses that direct string as the message content (current behavior preserved).
3. Given both a file path and a direct message string are provided, When I run the command, Then the system blocks with a clear error and no message is sent.
4. Given a non-existent or unreadable file path is provided, When I run the command, Then I receive a clear, actionable error message and no message is sent.
5. Given I run the command in verbose or dry-run/preview mode, When I provide a file path, Then the output indicates that content was loaded from the specified file path and shows a preview of the first 200 characters of the content without leaking sensitive data.
6. Given the provided file path points to an empty (or whitespace-only) file, When I run the command, Then the system blocks with a clear error and no message is sent.
7. Given the provided file content exceeds the allowable message length, When I run the command, Then the system blocks with a clear error shown in the console and no message is sent.
8. Character encoding is not validated. Given any file encoding, When I run the command, Then the system treats the file as UTF-8 text and does not fail due to encoding.
9. Given the provided file ends with trailing newline(s) or whitespace, When I run the command, Then the system trims trailing whitespace and newline(s) before sending the message.
10. Given the provided file contains Markdown formatting (e.g., headings, bold, lists), When I run the command to send or broadcast, Then the message is treated as Markdown and renders accordingly in the destination.

### Edge Cases

- File path points to an empty file: The system must block with a clear error; no message is sent.
- File size exceeds allowable message length: The system must block with a clear error shown in the console; no message is sent.
- Character encoding: Always assumed UTF-8. The system does not validate encoding; non-UTF-8 bytes may appear as replacement characters but will not cause an encoding-specific error.
- Trailing newline or whitespace at end of file: The system must trim trailing whitespace and final newline(s) before sending.
- Markdown formatting semantics: Messages are treated as Markdown and rendered accordingly by the destination; formatting should be preserved.
- File path safety and access: How should permission errors or locked files be reported to the user? Define standard error language and exit behavior.
- Both inputs provided (file + inline): The system must block with a clear error; no message is sent.

## Requirements (mandatory)

### Functional Requirements

- FR-001: The system MUST allow users to specify a file path to load the message content for applicable messaging commands.
- FR-002: The system MUST continue to allow users to provide the message content directly as an argument (no regression of current behavior).
- FR-003: When a valid file path is provided, the system MUST use the file's text as the message content for the operation.
- FR-004: If both a file path and a direct message are provided, the system MUST block with a clear error and MUST NOT send a message.
- FR-005: If the specified file cannot be found or read, the system MUST present a clear error and MUST NOT send a message.
- FR-006: The system MUST enforce a maximum message length of 2,000 characters; if the content exceeds this limit, the system MUST block with a clear error shown in the console and MUST NOT send a message.
- FR-007: The system MUST assume UTF-8 for file content and MUST NOT perform character encoding validation.
- FR-008: The system MUST preserve all existing modes (verbose and dry-run/preview) and reflect the chosen input source in user-facing output when those modes are enabled.
- FR-009: The system MUST provide consistent behavior across the single-send and broadcast commands.
- FR-010: The system SHOULD provide helpful guidance in errors (e.g., suggesting checking the path, permissions, or using direct message input as an alternative).
- FR-011: If the specified file is empty or contains only whitespace, the system MUST present a clear error and MUST NOT send a message.
- FR-012: The system MUST trim trailing whitespace and final newline(s) from the loaded message content before sending.
- FR-013: The system MUST treat message content as Markdown and ensure it is delivered for Markdown rendering by the destination platform; Markdown formatting must be preserved.

### Key Entities (include if feature involves data)

- Message Input: Represents the user's provided message content and its source. Attributes: source type (file | inline), content (text), and optional metadata (e.g., file path for diagnostics).
- Command Invocation: Represents a user's execution of a messaging command with inputs and modes (verbose, dry-run). Relationships: uses Message Input.

---

## Assumptions

- The destination platform renders Markdown content.
- The maximum message length is 2,000 characters (per FR-006).
- Available modes include verbose and dry-run/preview (per FR-008).
