## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

As a team communicator, I want to send the same message to multiple Slack channels simultaneously by selecting from predefined named channel lists in a configuration file, so that I can efficiently broadcast different types of announcements to appropriate channel groups (e.g., "engineering-teams", "marketing-channels", "all-hands") without manually specifying channels each time.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a configuration file contains multiple named channel lists with valid channel IDs, **When** I send a broadcast message to a specific list name, **Then** the message is delivered to all channels in that named list
2. **Given** a configuration file with a channel list containing mixed valid and invalid channel IDs, **When** I send a broadcast message to that list, **Then** the message is sent to valid channels and I receive error details for invalid ones
3. **Given** an empty configuration file or missing channel list name, **When** I attempt to send a broadcast message, **Then** I receive a clear error message explaining the configuration issue
4. **Given** I want to verify a specific channel list, **When** I use a dry-run mode with the list name, **Then** I see which channels would receive the message without actually sending it
5. **Given** multiple channel lists exist in the configuration, **When** I request to see available lists, **Then** I receive a list of all named channel groups I can target

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the configuration file is corrupted or has invalid YAML format?
- How does the system handle network failures during multi-channel delivery?
- What occurs when some channels are private and the bot lacks access?
- How are duplicate channel IDs within a named list handled?
- What happens when a user specifies a channel list name that doesn't exist in the configuration?
- How does the system behave when a named list is empty?

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST load named channel lists from a YAML configuration file specified by the user
- **FR-002**: System MUST support both channel IDs (C1234567890) and channel names (#general) within each named list
- **FR-003**: System MUST allow users to specify which named channel list to target for message broadcasting
- **FR-004**: System MUST send the same message content to all channels in the specified named list
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide delivery status for each channel (success/failure with reason)
- **FR-006**: System MUST continue attempting delivery to remaining channels if some deliveries fail
- **FR-007**: System MUST validate configuration file format and named list existence before attempting message delivery
- **FR-008**: Users MUST be able to specify the configuration file path via command line
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide a dry-run mode to preview target channels for a specific named list without sending messages
- **FR-010**: System MUST handle authentication failures gracefully for inaccessible channels
- **FR-011**: Configuration file format MUST be YAML
- **FR-012**: System MUST support up to 100 channels per named list
- **FR-013**: System MUST provide a command to list all available named channel lists in the configuration
- **FR-014**: System MUST validate that specified named list exists in the configuration before processing

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **Channel Configuration**: YAML file containing multiple named channel lists, each with a descriptive name and list of channel identifiers
- **Named Channel List**: A collection of channels grouped under a meaningful name (e.g., "engineering-teams", "marketing-channels") for targeted broadcasting
- **Broadcast Message**: The message content to be sent to all channels in a specified named list
- **Delivery Result**: Status information for each channel delivery attempt including success/failure and error details
- **Channel Target**: Individual channel specification within a named list that can be either an ID or name format
- **List Selector**: User-specified name that identifies which named channel list to target for broadcasting
