# Research: Multi-Channel Message Broadcasting

**Feature**: Load channel lists from YAML config and broadcast messages  
**Date**: September 23, 2025

## Technical Decisions

### YAML Configuration Parser

**Decision**: Use `js-yaml` library  
**Rationale**: Well-established, TypeScript-friendly YAML parser with excellent Node.js support and strong type safety features  
**Alternatives considered**:

- `yaml` package - newer but less ecosystem adoption
- Native JSON with comments - less user-friendly than YAML

### Configuration File Structure

**Decision**: Nested object structure with named lists  
**Rationale**: Enables logical grouping of channels and easy CLI selection by name  
**Structure**:

```yaml
channel_lists:
  engineering-teams:
    - '#backend-dev'
    - '#frontend-dev'
    - 'C1234567890'
  marketing-channels:
    - '#marketing-general'
    - '#social-media'
  all-hands:
    - '#general'
    - '#announcements'
```

### CLI Interface Extension

**Decision**: Extend existing commander.js pattern with new `broadcast` command  
**Rationale**: Consistent with existing `send-message` command structure, leverages established patterns  
**Command structure**: `slack-messenger broadcast <list-name> <message> [options]`

### Channel ID Resolution

**Decision**: Support both channel IDs (C1234567890) and channel names (#general) in configuration  
**Rationale**: Provides flexibility for users who have different ways of identifying channels  
**Implementation**: Use Slack Web API to resolve channel names to IDs when needed

### Error Handling Strategy

**Decision**: Fail-fast validation with graceful degradation during delivery  
**Rationale**: Validate configuration and channel list existence before attempting any deliveries, but continue sending to valid channels if some fail  
**Pattern**: Validate → Report planned deliveries → Execute with per-channel status tracking

### Rate Limiting Approach

**Decision**: Sequential delivery with built-in Slack Web API rate limiting  
**Rationale**: The @slack/web-api library handles rate limiting automatically, sequential approach ensures proper throttling  
**Alternatives considered**: Batch parallel requests - rejected due to rate limit complexity

### Dry-Run Implementation

**Decision**: Use existing service patterns with delivery simulation  
**Rationale**: Leverage existing SlackService but add dry-run flag to prevent actual API calls  
**Output**: Show resolved channel IDs, names, and planned message content without delivery

## Integration Points

### Existing Services to Extend

- **SlackService**: Add broadcast methods for multi-channel delivery
- **ConfigurationService**: Add YAML configuration loading
- **CLI Service**: Add broadcast command parsing
- **ConsoleService**: Enhance output formatting for multi-channel results

### New Models Required

- **ChannelConfiguration**: Represents YAML config structure
- **NamedChannelList**: Individual named list with channels
- **BroadcastResult**: Aggregated delivery results across channels
- **BroadcastOptions**: CLI options specific to broadcasting

### Dependencies to Add

- `js-yaml`: YAML parsing and validation
- `@types/js-yaml`: TypeScript definitions

## Testing Strategy

### Contract Testing

- Mock Slack Web API responses for channel resolution
- Test YAML configuration parsing with various formats
- Validate error responses for invalid configurations

### Integration Testing

- End-to-end broadcast flow with test configuration
- Error handling with mixed valid/invalid channels
- Dry-run functionality verification
- CLI argument parsing and validation

### Edge Case Testing

- Empty configuration files
- Non-existent named lists
- Malformed YAML syntax
- Network failures during delivery
- Rate limit handling
- Duplicate channels in lists

## Performance Considerations

### Channel Limits

- Maximum 100 channels per named list (as specified)
- No limit on number of named lists in configuration
- Configuration file size should remain reasonable for parsing

### Memory Usage

- YAML configuration loaded once per command execution
- Channel resolution results cached during single broadcast
- Delivery results accumulated in memory for final reporting

### Network Efficiency

- Sequential API calls to respect rate limits
- Reuse authentication tokens across requests
- Minimal API calls for channel resolution (resolve once per unique channel)

## Security Considerations

### Configuration File Access

- YAML configuration should be readable by CLI user
- No sensitive data stored in configuration (only channel references)
- File path validation to prevent directory traversal

### Slack API Security

- Reuse existing authentication patterns from current implementation
- No additional security requirements beyond existing send-message feature
- Error messages should not expose sensitive channel information

## Deployment Impact

### Breaking Changes

- None - this is an additive feature to existing CLI

### Migration Requirements

- None - existing functionality unchanged
- Users must create YAML configuration files to use new feature

### Documentation Updates

- CLI help text for new broadcast command
- Example YAML configuration file
- Updated README with broadcast usage examples
