# Feature Specification: Initialize TypeScript Console Application

**Feature Branch**: `001-init-console-app`  
**Created**: 2025-09-23  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Init console app. language is TypeScript"

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation

When creating this spec from a user prompt:

1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

As a developer, I want to initialize a new TypeScript console application project so that I can start building a command-line tool with proper TypeScript configuration, dependency management, and development workflow.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** an empty project directory, **When** the initialization process is complete, **Then** the project structure contains all necessary configuration files and dependencies
2. **Given** the initialized project, **When** a developer runs the build command, **Then** TypeScript code compiles successfully without errors
3. **Given** the initialized project, **When** a developer runs the application, **Then** a basic console application executes and displays expected output
4. **Given** the initialized project, **When** a developer runs tests, **Then** the test framework executes and reports results

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the project directory already contains files?
- How does the system handle missing development dependencies?
- What occurs if the initialization process is interrupted?

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST create a proper TypeScript project structure with source and test directories
- **FR-002**: System MUST generate package.json with TypeScript and required dependencies configured
- **FR-003**: System MUST create TypeScript configuration file with strict type checking enabled
- **FR-004**: System MUST set up testing framework and configuration for unit testing
- **FR-005**: System MUST create basic entry point that demonstrates console application functionality
- **FR-006**: System MUST configure build scripts for compilation and execution
- **FR-007**: System MUST include linting and formatting configuration for code quality
- **FR-008**: System MUST create basic documentation explaining project setup and usage
- **FR-009**: Project MUST be compatible with Node.js version 22
- **FR-010**: System MUST support Vitest testing framework for unit testing
- **FR-011**: Build output MUST be exported to "dist" directory with compiled JavaScript files

### Key Entities

- **Project Structure**: Represents the directory layout and file organization for the TypeScript console application
- **Configuration Files**: Represents TypeScript, package management, and tooling configuration files
- **Entry Point**: Represents the main application file that serves as the console application starting point
- **Build Artifacts**: Represents compiled JavaScript output and associated files
